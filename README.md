# About

Just a simple mod for [Rimworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100)

The game provides a ground-penetrating ore scanner and also has alien technology, but can't ground-penetrating-scan if the scanner has a roof over it.

The mod is available on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2870663873).

# Why

I like playing in cold map regions like the north/south pole where raiders have a hard time dealing with the temperatures, and it makes surviving a little tougher.

I also happened to need ore found underground by drilling and couldn't scan for its location without dealing with below -100F temperatures
